    <h1>PRIMITIVE CARE</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2>
    <p1> Every day, more and more medical apps are being developed. People are now worried about their health after the outbreak of this pandemic. In order to make informed decisions about their health, people want to know how they are doing now. Millions of lives have been affected by COVID-19 around the world. Now more than ever before, people place a high value on their health. Apps for healthcare have also been impacted by this change in focus. The need for immediate care by patients is one of our major motivators for developing this app. It is a significant problem in health care that, for various reasons, people are not always willing to take full responsibility for their own care.</p1>
    <p2> Currently, many researchers are studying how "smart" technology can be developed, used, and evaluated in a broader health-care context. These studies encompass a wide range of human studies, target audiences, purposes, and technology platforms. As part of our development effort, we are developing a mobile app that can diagnose diseases, suggest basic medications, and schedule an appointment for further evaluation with a doctor. In this proposal, we look at how smart technologies can assist people in doing what they cannot do on their own, while also encouraging (or helping) them to do as much for themselves as possible.</p2>
    <p3> A collaboration is being planned with Spectrum Health, and they will sponsor the project. A worldwide spectrum health network makes it easy for this app to reach as many people as possible. Through this app, the patient will be able to check their vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate. Additionally, we intend to expand the features to check for additional health and illness concerns by allowing patients to input symptoms that raise the possibility of particular diseases, suggest basic treatments, and attempt to schedule a consultation with a doctor from the relevant department for further assessment. To sum up, this program is simple for illeterates to use as well. The most individuals it can reach are its principal objective.</p3>
    <h2> ANTICIPATED TECHNOLOGIES:</h2>
    <p1> For building our project we require Java, React native.</p1>
    <h2> METHOD/APPROACH: </h2>
    <p1> For developing this project, firstly we would collect the data of several diseases, diagnoise the diseases, collect the data for basic medication , linking the data collected for basic medication and diagnosis of disease. Later on we would collect the data of doctors belonging to any particular hospital and according to their specialization, we would inter link them with the set of diseases, so that the user can connect directly to a specialized doctor (if he is not satisfied with basic medication). At the end for building the application we will be using react native.</p1>
