1)Allergies
Allergens, normally toxic substances, cause allergies, which are an immunological reaction. 
Causes
Immune systems that are particularly sensitive and react when exposed to allergens are found in allergy sufferers. 
Symptoms
Symptoms Allergies can have a wide range of symptoms due to their numerous potential origins. Airborne allergens, such as pollen and pet dander, are likely to result in the following symptoms
•	Hives or skin rashes
•	Gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, excessing gas, indigestion)
•	Tingling or swelling of the lips, face, or tongue
•	Itchiness
•	Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Primary medication:
Corticosteroids
Corticosteroids treat symptoms by reducing inflammation brought on by allergies. Sprays containing corticosteroids can help prevent and treat runny or stuffy noses.	Budesonide (Rhinocort)
Fluticasone furoate (Flonase Sensimist)
Fluticasone propionate (Flonase Allergy Relief)
Pills and liquids
All sorts of allergic responses can induce severe symptoms, which are treated with oral corticosteroids. 
Oral corticosteroids on prescription include:
•	Prednisolone (Prelone)
•	Prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos)
•	Methylprednisolone (Medrol)







2)Mononucleosis
Cause
The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is transmitted by saliva, causes the sickness known as mononucleosis. 
Symptoms
Extreme weariness, which forces the sick person to nap frequently, is the most well-known symptom of "mono." Get checked for mono if you suffer such severe exhaustion along with additional symptoms as swollen lymph nodes and spleen, sore throat, fever, appetite loss, and muscular aches. The presence of antibodies made by white blood cells serves as the basis for diagnosing mono.
Primary medication:
Nucleoside Analogues (Acyclovir, Valacyclovir, Ganciclovir, and Valganciclovir) 

3)Hepatitis B
The most common infectious disease, hepatitis B affects roughly 2 billion people worldwide, or more than 25% of the world's population.
Symptoms
•	Fatigue.
•	Loss of appetite.
•	Nausea.
•	Vomiting.
•	Abdominal pain.
•	Dark urine.
•	Clay-colored bowel movements.
•	Fever
Primary treatment:
Antiviral drugs are a possible part of the chronic hepatitis B treatment. 
 entecavir (Baraclude), tenofovir (Viread), lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), and telbivudine, can aid in the fight against the virus and reduce the rate at which it can harm your liver. These medications are ingested orally.

4)Gastritis:
inflammation of the stomach's lining. Most frequently, infection with the same bacterium that most commonly results in stomach ulcers or constant use of specific painkillers is what causes gastritis inflammation.
•	Stomach upset
•	abdominal pain
•	nausea and vomiting
•	bloating and gas
•	weight loss and/or loss of appetite


Primary medication:
Naturally, the first line of treatment is to get rid of the irritant. To lessen stomach acid, you can take antacid medications, stronger "H2 antagonists" (like Tagamet or Zantac), or "Proton pump inhibitors" (like Nexium). There may be a need for anti-nausea medicine.
5)Ulcerative Colitis
ulceration (sores) and inflammation in the digestive tract are symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
Symptoms
•	Diarrhea, often with blood or pus
•	Rectal bleeding — passing small amount of blood with stool
•	Abdominal pain and cramping
•	Rectal pain
•	Urgency to defecate
•	Inability to defecate despite urgency
•	Weight loss
•	Fatigue
Primary medication:
STELARA is used to reduce the inflammation
