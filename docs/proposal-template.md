# Introduction



# Anticipated Technologies
For building our project we require Java, React native.


# Method/Approach
For developing this project, firstly we would collect the data of several diseases, diagnoise the diseases, collect the data for basic medication , linking the data collected for basic medication and diagnosis of disease. Later on we would collect the data of doctors belonging to any particular hospital and according to their specialization, we would inter link them with the set of diseases, so that the user can connect directly to a specialized doctor (if he is not satisfied with basic medication). At the end for building the application we will be using react native.


# Estimated Timeline
Major milestone for our project is collecting the data of doctors and interlinking them with particular set of diseases. I believe that inorder to reach that point, it may take upto twenty days.


# Anticipated Problems
The data set of diseases is much larger, collecting all the data of basic medication for every disease will be challenging. We need to overcome these problems by spending large amount of time on it and analysing the data properly.
