# Change management plan
Every day, more and more medical apps are being developed. People are now worried about their health after the outbreak of this pandemic. In order to make informed decisions about their health, people want to know how they are doing now. Millions of lives have been affected by COVID-19 around the world. Now more than ever before, people place a high value on their health. Apps for healthcare have also been impacted by this change in focus. The need for immediate care by patients is one of our major motivators for developing this app. It is a significant problem in health care that, for various reasons, people are not always willing to take full responsibility for their own care.

Currently, many researchers are studying how "smart" technology can be developed, used, and evaluated in a broader health-care context. These studies encompass a wide range of human studies, target audiences, purposes, and technology platforms. As part of our development effort, we are developing a mobile app that can diagnose diseases, suggest basic medications, and schedule an appointment for further evaluation with a doctor. In this application, we look at how smart technologies can assist people in doing what they cannot do on their own, while also encouraging (or helping) them to do as much for themselves as possible.

Most of the people will be using either android or mac devices.This application is compatible with Android devices and as well as Mac devices. It can also be used on desktop. It is easily compatible with any device. This application is highly secured, as it is built as an react native application.

In our application we have an help tab, which is used to resolve the issues at any point of time. It can accessed at anytime while using the application. Our support team is available 24*7.
